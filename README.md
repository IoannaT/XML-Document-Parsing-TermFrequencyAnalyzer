# XML-Document-Parsing-TermFrequencyAnlyzer 
A project for the course of Information Retrieval @CS_AUEB

Main Class Converter.java 
  Reads the doc-term.txt and converts it into a valid .xml document

Main Class TermFrequency.java
  Reads an .xml file whicÎ· parse with DOM Parser. 
  Also reads the term-vocab.txt document and tokenizes it order to compare its terms with the .xml ones.
  For each document, calculates the frequency for each term and dislays it with a descending order.
  
  
PS1: In order to run this project please make sure the reading docs are stored on C:/... drive.
PS2: For this project I used the NPL collection, which you can download from the link below.

PS3: For the Term Frequency class a proper solution would implement a Stemmer as well. 
     Please feel free to include your code :)
